initializeToStandAlone
	"Set up the receiver, created by a #basicNew and now ready to be initialized, as a fully-formed morph suitable for providing a graphic for a parts bin surrogate, and, when such a parts-bin surrogate is clicked on, for attaching to the hand as a viable stand-alone morph.  Because of historical precedent, #initialize has been expected to handle this burden, though a great number of morphs actually cannot stand alone.  In any case, by default we call the historical #initialize, though unhappily, so that all existing morphs will work no worse than before when using this protocol."
