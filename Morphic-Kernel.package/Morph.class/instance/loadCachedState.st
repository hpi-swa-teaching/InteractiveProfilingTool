loadCachedState
	"Load the cached state of this morph. This method may be called to pre-load the cached state of a morph to avoid delays when it is first used. (Cached state can always be recompued on demand, so a morph should not rely on this method being called.) Implementations of this method should do 'super loadCachedState'. This default implementation does nothing."
